# --------------- Stack------------------------- last in first out -------

A stack is a linear data structure, which means that all elements are arranged in sequential order. It results that the push and pop operations can only happen at one end of the structure, in this case, the top of the stack.

Sometimes there can be more than two operations in a stack data structure. Sometimes we might use the isEmpty operation to check if the stack is empty, and the peek operation to return the top element without modifying the stack.

Inside js there is no inbuilt stacks and queues ;
therefore we use a class for stacks;
